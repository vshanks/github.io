[Habitat Marte](http://www.habitatmarte.com/) is a space analog station [~100km west of Natal, Brazil](https://goo.gl/maps/fxbxGofz4tgraKVA6) that I began participating in earlier this summer.
Now, let's start at the very beginning: 

### Q. What is a space analog mission?

Time-bound close quarters exploratory missions made to simulate the hostile conditions in space habitats (think ISS or a human settlement on Mars) are called space analog missions. They are used to research methods, protocols, human psychological response and nascent technology by mimicking the variables that one would expect in space habitats i.e. they are designed to be an analog to them. 

### Q. Why have space analog missions?
For so many reasons - that I continue to learn about. A few that I've discovered so far include: 
* Testing graspers and locomotion techniques for mobile robotic equipment
* Testing A/R medical procedures
* Testing the limits of remote medicine
* Designing ISRU systems that augment oxygen and water supplies
* Studying the influence of prolonged social isolation on the human psyche
* Designing physical and mental wellness protocols

### Q. Varsha - you're not an astronaut - why would you care?
I'm not an astronaut - this is true. My growth mindset wants to respond with - *not yet!*

Space habitats and remote, hostile habitats on Earth - imagine a research station in Antarctica - are just that - remote and hostile. Help is far away, and in many cases, not a viable option. Activities that are critical to existence need to be extra predictable and extra dull. Analog missions serve as ripe testing grounds and data gathering resources for researchers, astronauts, technologists, engineers and doctors. 
All of this is extra relevant in the era of climate change. It is not a far stretch to imagine remote and hostile environments on Earth that are the result of the impact of climate change on particularly vulnerable regions. 

### Q. But why should you - Varsha - care?
As a product person and an AI practitioner, I care because it is about building empathy for your customer - Product 101. Understand your customer's needs by stepping into their shoes and feeling their pain points as your own. In each of my experiences as an analog mission astronaut, I learnt new and valuable things that I can use in the future when building solutions, implementing ideas and strategizing product offerings. 

### Q. Did you do it because you get called an analog mission astronaut?
Maybe. It really is rather cool!

### Q. Are there other analog missions?
Yes! And they are all over the world. This is a non-exhaustive list:
