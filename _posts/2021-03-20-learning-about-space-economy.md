Where should one start to learn about the New Space Economy and much more ...
<!--more-->

Contributing to humanity's progress outward and beyond has been a childhood dream of mine that for the longest time sat shyly within the dusty confines of the metaphorical miniature wooden box tucked away behind 2011's Halloween costume. I started writing this first part of a mini-series last year in 2020. I had just embarked on my journey to learn as much as I could about the new space economy - the one unfolding in my lifetime. One of the first questions I asked was - So, what is the space sector really about and how do I learn about it? I'm coming around to answering this only in 2021, because that's how pandemics tend to affect my productivity.

In subsequent parts of this mini-series, the big questions I plan to address are: if one made a mind map of the space sector, what would the little squiggles look like and what would they say?, how does one contribute to the space sector? what do the adjacent verticals and supply chains look like? what tools and technologies are different and similar from the land of traditional AI/ML in the software industry?

### Q. Where should I start?
<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/posts_images/space_economy.jpg" alt="" /></span>The space sector is endlessly fascinating - of course I would say that! It's also multi-disciplinary and that's brilliant! Again, of course I would say that because my background is also multi-disciplinary. But the tricky bit really is that there is no one single source of great information because everyone's in it for different reasons and interests. Therefore, I would advocate the following approach, in order:

<ol>
<li>Level Set: Start with space investors</li>
<li>Read voraciously: Interesting articles</li> 
<li>Listen Up: Find space podcasts and newsletters</li>
<li>Build a community: Find not-for-profit and advocacy organizations</li>
<li>Explore: Speak to strangers</li>
</ol>
</p>
We will go over each item above in detail now.


### Q. How do you level set?
<p>
Look for investors in space companies like <a href="https://www.spacecapital.com">Space Capital</a>, <a href="https://seraphim.vc/">Seraphim Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.spacedventures.com/">Spaced Ventures</a> and many others. These firms take great pains to understand the space economy at large because their businesses depend on it. They share their investment reports, sector maps and portfolio companies through their website which makes for excellent reading! Their market maps for example - <a href="https://www.spacecapital.com/quarterly">Space Capital Quarterly</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SeraphimCapital/status/1369723027454373888/photo/1">Seraphim's Spacetech Map</a> make for an in-depth lens.</p>

### Q. What sorts of things should I google for?
Ah, the tricky one. Googling 'space' will only get you so far. If you're interesting in technologies, focus your energies on space technologies. This advice is applicable to any area of interest - the space economy, space datasets, rovers and exploration, space mining, microgravity agriculture etc. The hardest part, I found, is starting out - everything else flows from there. Taking part in [analog missions]({% post_url 2020-09-25-space-analog-missions %}) proved to be the catalyst I needed to pick up my initial vocabulary. A few links to reading materials on the space economy are:

</ul>

### Q. What should I be listening to?
<p>If you're like me, a large part of my daily commute (assuming you still have one) was filled with podcasts. It's such a great way to detach yourself from a screen (I realize the irony of that statement given where you're reading this!). There are so many wonderful reading and listening resources out there! A few mentions are <a href="https://spaceq.ca/">SpaceQ</a>, <a href="https://spacenews.com/">SpaceNews</a>,  <a href="https://www.planetary.org/planetary-radio">Planetary Radio</a> and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/gravity-assist">Gravity Assist</a>.</p>

### Q. How do I build a community?
<p>Seek out not-for-profit and advocacy organizations. The next step is to make friends! This is the part where I tell you that it's easier to walk 10 km with a few friends or that you are not an island etc etc., but you already know that. Embedding yourself in organizations that are already in the sector is a wonderfully safe way to explore your interests, learn the jargon and ask silly questions. A few that come to mind are the <a href="https://css.ca/">Canadian Space Society</a>, <a href="https://spacegeneration.org/">SGAC</a>, <a href="https://www.openplanetary.org/">Open Planetary</a> etc.</p>

### Q. Exploring sounds scary. Where do I start?
The biggest leap of faith comes last and that's talking to people who work in the sector. You might not know exactly what you're looking for, but you're definitely looking for advice. As intimidating as it may seem at first - try it anyway. It's a very rewarding experience and you will learn a tremendous amount. If you're completely new to the sector, at first, you will stumble, be slightly incoherent and blush like a tomato - but that's OK! Persevere and you'll get better at asking questions and even better still - you'll get pertinent answers.

### Q. Do you have a list of all these things?
Yep! The following airtable link is my living document that collates these resources:
