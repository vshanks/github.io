Space design for a Martian habitat during Mission 47 at Habitat Marte and much more ...
<!--more-->

Mission 47 was my second virtual space analog mission at Habitat Marte. In this post, I will relate my learnings from it in a format that I hope has become familiar: question and answer style.

If this is the first time you're encountering the terms space analogs or analog missions, flip over to [Space Analog Missions]({% post_url 2020-09-25-space-analog-missions %}) on the whats and whys of space analog missions. The remainder of this article will make a lot more sense! In my first virtual space analog mission at Habitat Marte, we focussed on recycling and sustainability in a Martian habitat. You can read more about the mission in my [previous post here]({% post_url 2020-09-27-habitat-marte-part1 %}).

If you're familiar with how missions at Habitat Marte are structured and run, [skip ahead to the details of Mission 47](#Q-What-was-the-theme-of-Mission-47-at-Habitat-Marte?). 

### Q. How does a virtual analog mission at Habitat Marte work?
7 individuals with a passion for space exploration and settlement are recruited from around the world to form an analog astronaut team. Each team member is given the responsibility to design and imagine a distinct facility within a human space habitat on Mars. The facilities include:
* Main Station
* Launch Centre
* Greenhouse
* Sanitation Centre
* Health Centre
* Engineering Station
* Power Station

### Q. How long do missions last?
Typically, for 7 days.

### Q. What was your role in the mission?
My role was chief of the launch centre - an area within the habitat that ships would arrive and depart from. If this makes you think of airports on Earth, you're on the right track! For this mission, I chose to focus on the following areas:
* Construction and maintenance of landing pad facilities
* Mining in-situ resources for oxygen, water and fuel generation
* Robotic swarm technology to enable these functions with implied redundancy

Each centre chief presents their research on their chosen facility. This gives everyone in the mission an opportunity to learn about techniques, protocols and technologies in adjacent realms. 

### Q. What was the theme of Mission 47 at Habitat Marte?
In this mission, we focussed on the architectural design of the habitat. This included designing the layouts, evaluating materials, machinery and locations of the various facilities within the habitat.
