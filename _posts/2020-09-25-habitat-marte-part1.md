The summer of 2020 was a turning point for a bundle of reasons - Covid19 being the most obvious. Another momentous event for me was some friends introducing me to Professor Julio Rezende and his team at Habitat Marte in Brazil. 

[Habitat Marte](<http://www.habitatmarte.com/>) is a space analog station located in the municipality of [Cai√ßara do Rio do Vento in Brazil](https://goo.gl/maps/fxbxGofz4tgraKVA6). It is ~100km from Natal, capital of the state of Rio Grande do Norte. The missions that were generally conducted with in-person participants, transformed to being completely virtual this summer - and although that transformation happened for reasons that are less than ideal (aka a pandemic), I was very grateful and humbled by the opportunity to participate. 

We've covered the whats and whys of space analog missions [before in a previous post]({% post_url 2020-09-25-space-analog-missions %}).

### Q. How does an analog virtual mission at Habitat Marte work?
<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/posts_images/habitat_marte_43.png" alt="" /></span>7 individuals with a passion for space exploration and settlement are recruited from around the world to form a team. Each team member is given the responsibility to design and imagine a distinct facility within a space habitat on Mars. </p>

### Q. How long do the missions last?
Typically, for 7 days.

### Q. Does a mission have purpose?
Absolutely! Each virtual mission is themed - my first one - was about recycling on Mars. Our mission was to design and conceptualize the needs of 7 distinct facilities with an eye towards recycling, sustainability and self-reliance in the face of a Martian dust-storm that lasted 7 days. The facilities included:
* Main Station
* Launch Centre
* Greenhouse
* Sanitation Centre
* Health Centre
* Engineering Station
* Power Station

### Q. What was your role in the mission?
My role was the chief of the launch centre - an area within the habitat that ships would arrive and depart from. If this makes you think of airports on Earth, you're on the right track! The areas that I chose to focus on for this mission were:
* Construction and maintenance of the landing pad facilities
* Mining in-situ resources for oxygen, water and fuel generation
* Robotic swarm technology to enable these functions with embedded redundancy
Each centre chief presents their research on their chosen facility. This gives everyone in the mission an opportunity to learn about techniques, protocols and technologies in adjacent realms. 

### Q. This sounds cool! Is there proof?
I'm all about documenting things - Here are some links to the material that I presented at my first mission:

It's rough, and it improves for my next mission which you can read about [here]({% post_url 2020-09-25-habitat-marte-part2 %}).

### Q. What are some other things that you learnt about?
To give you a taste for the range of topics covered:
* Dr. Susan Jewell, the CEO of the Mars Academy briefed us on the advances in A/R and mixed reality for telemedicine. We covered 3D printing of spare parts powered by solar energy as well as the limitations of medicine in space - surgery is currently not feasible because anesthesiology in microgravity environments is an unsolved problem. 5G will be critical to the new world of telemedicine. 
* Davi Souza, a student of Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, covered the challenges and advances in aquaponic greenhouses (that's hydroponics + fish). Apart from having a separate greenhouse within the habitat, embedding miniature versions into the design of every facility was noted as an important feature, given the limited real estate in space habitats. Sensor based control of LED lighting for plant growth, monitoring of crops for pests and health enabled through automation to reduce the room for human error is the real game changer to this critical component of the habitat. 

### Q. Where can I find out more? 
This article only touches the tip of the iceberg. All our sessions were recorded and are available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/HabitatMarte).
