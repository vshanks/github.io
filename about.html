				<p>Varsha Shankar is a product, ai and data science professional 
					with a background in Computer Science, Robotics and Business in Toronto, Canada. 
					She loves building cool new products, experimenting with new ideas and bringing 
					them to life!
				</p>
				<p>Her hopes and dreams are to contribute to the space <span class="fa fa-space-shuttle fa-spin fa-lg"></span> 
				<span class="fa fa-rocket fa-spin fa-lg"></span> sector. She is currently engaged in 
					<ul>
						<li>Volunteering with the Canadian Space Society - Managing membership and growth</li>
						<li>Participating and being an invited researcher in the Virtual Space Analog Missions at Habitat Marte</li>
						<li>Advising Spaced Ventures with their data needs</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>She really likes learning - as evidenced by her three tenures at three different 
				schools - 
					<ul>
						<li>MBA @ Rotman School of Management at University of Toronto</li>
						<li>MSE Robotics @ GRASP Lab, University of Pennsylvania</li>
						<li>BE Computer Science @ Delhi Technological University</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>When she isn't exploring something new in the world of science and product, she's 
				usually out exploring the world. No travel is too small - the 20 km walk around the city 
				or a city 2000 km away. She'll try every sport around, discover that she's awful at it, 
				but will persevere for the fun of it. The few exceptions to this rule include swimming and 
				frisbee (let's count that as a sport, shall we). 
				<p>
				<p>She's passionate about gender equality and mentors those starting out in their career as 
				data and product enthusiasts.
